                <p>
                    I was born in Tacoma and raised in Seattle, Washington. After what seems like a lifetime of performing my
                    music across the country, I have returned home and once again reside in the Pacific Northwest.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I have been writing stories since grade school. A few of my books were circulated in high school with a warning
                    and a half smile from the officials; I suppose I should have had the decency to blush.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    During that time I discovered another outlet for writing that intrigued me. Studying the genre of folk & rock music,
                    I taught myself guitar by removing all the strings and putting them back on, two at a time. Discerning
                    which combination of fret positions sounded pleasant, I ultimately formed chords. I had no clue as to what they were
                    called until I intereacted with other musicians and from then on I was writing my own music and lyrics. Now a published, 
                    Performing/Songwriter/Poet I have composed over 1,140 songs.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Throughout this time I continued writing stories, treating it as an ongoing exercise; an outlet when I wasn't creating
                    songs. Now I am winding down the traveling and performing aspect of my music while continuing to record my own compositions
                    in the studio. Smooth instrumental jazz versions of my catalog are among the latest projects.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I have redirected my focus on my books. This is the first time I am seeking to publish those that are finished, as well as 
                    promote interest in my writings and works which are nearly finished or ongoing. I have incorporated my photography in several 
                    books which allows me to pursue that facet of my art.

                    Further insights into my biography can be found in all the rest of my projects. At your request I can offer you any of these.
