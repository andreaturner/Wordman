                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that day, Raven soared on the winds and called each breeze his<br>
                        brother. Then came the day the winds halted their run from the far North Augustan Mountains<br>
                        and lifted Raven with their voice. And Raven was warned by the winds of storm:

                &ldquo;Beware when Ever&rsquo;ice, the Spirit of Winter<br>
                Seeks what is not his to hold.<br>
                He would steal from Da&rsquo;born, the Spirit of Spring,<br>
                And in so doing, take also from Sun&rsquo;sha, the Spirit of Summer,<br>
                And Co&rsquo;napa, the Spirit of Fall.
                <br>
                <br>
                When this has come to pass<br>   
                The earth shall grow cold and weep<br>    
                And the animals cry aloud and mourn.<br>
                Many voices will be heard to say &ldquo;Surely this is the end.&rdquo;<br>
                And the Mother Spirit of Earth will seem to agree.
                <br>
                <br>
                But in that time of times there will also be whispers,<br>
                Whispers of a Shaman...<br>
                One who loves the earth...<br>
                One who walks with the animals...<br>
                One who would war with Nature...<br>
                In the search to reclaim the Mother Spirit&rsquo;s children,<br>
                And return to her, the Seasons.&rdquo;

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Raven set out on his own, to search the four corners of the land, looking for this Shaman.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Great Spirit Ever&rsquo;ice did rebuke and punish the winds and set them <br>
                        against Raven. And it is said that this was first time Raven ever flew against the wind&#33;
