                the anti-thesis of the creative force has found its&#39; host disciples in the Shinghaut priest of the late Babylon. They in turn have passed
                their deadly gifts on to thier new pawns on each of the three worlds. Now Iftmus, the land cats are in their death throes as the newly perverted
                magics of Sha-talon twist and pervert the balance of Flow.

                of Greenstone, the corridor between all three worlds.

                in Babylon. Used by the Shinghaut priests to communicate with the force they call Baushra&#39;, it has become the focus of worship fo the new and evil
                cult. The priests are reinitiating human blood sacrifice and planning the assassination of two kings in an effort to unite two failing empires as one
                force. This will in turn twart the invading Persians, plunging the world into war and inadvertently change the time line future of the coming Alexandrian
                Empire. In blood and suffereing they will change history and condemn the world to a new dark age.
