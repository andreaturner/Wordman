            the anti-thesis of the creative force has found its&#39; host disciples in the Shinghaut priest of the late Babylon. They in turn have passed
            their deadly gifts on to thier new pawns on each of the three worlds. Now Iftmus, the land cats are in their death throes as the newly perverted
            magics of Sha-talon twist and pervert the balance of Flow.

            and piece together some of the related prophesies. Since their own worlds are threatened as well, they are forced by events to set off in search
            of Greenstone, the corridor between all three worlds.

            who possessed the magics before the Panduran cat claimed thier new twisted version. It is here that one of the heroes must bury the demon of his own madness
            lest it betray his true motives. Another must do battle with race and age prejudices before they can even begin to confront the true enemy. A third must
            die and lose all innocence, if others are ever to be granted a chance at any type of life.

                                <span>(Ab-ah-sin-ee-an)</span> This cat was of the smaller breeds, small boned and sleek. Born in the area that would later become the province of
                                La-mor they were the first to control and treat Sha-talon, the magic&#39;s of Iftmus, as an art.   They separated themselves from all other
                                cats to reside at Greensun and it was then that the Cha-tain cat closed off the larger portion of the Grasswater and allowed no other cat
                                to trespass it. Since then, little more is known about the Abyssinians. The last entry into Kylor of their disappearance was the fact that
                                they totally vanished almost within a single Sunfall with no message nor explanation. The Cha-tain make no comment of it other than to
                                affirm the Abyssinians are indeed gone.

                                A Birch like tree that sheds it&#39;s white bark twice a season.  When chewed during religious festivals on Iftmus, cats use the hallucinogenic
                                properties of the bark to meditate and commune with the Spirit of Felis.

                                <span>(Ah-rap-ah-sue)</span> A breed of horse on Axtoph existing only on the Northland Plains. The Northland Mercenaries lay sole claim to the horse
                                and protect that religiously.  An Araupaso, is known for its strength and endurance and it&#39;s longevity, living for thirty to forty spans.
                                Unknown to all but the Northland Mercenaries the Araupaso possesses the ability to communicate within its own breed making it a sentient life
                                form. This is not an animal that is owned. If any are allowed to ride one, it is only by consent of the horse.

                                <span>(Chawn)</span> Those cat on Iftmus of mixed blood resulting from to unaccepted cross breeding. These cats have no status and are allowed no
                                title nor name other than to be called a Ch&#39;aun. Treated as misfits in Iftmus they either die from the lack of belonging to a pride or flee to the Grasswater seeking
                                the fabled sanctuary, Greensun.

                                They are the only breed of cat living on the Grasswater of Iftmus and are rumored to have once served the Abyssinian cat. They tolerate no other cat in their domain
                                though many believe that they now allow the Ch&#39;aun cat, sanctuary through the Grasswater to seek and find refuge at Greensun. Due to their isolation little more is
                                known about them. The Shi-kauti that bring Ky-lor to the Cha-tain are strangely quiet about any of their secrets and ways.

                                mind commands but do not communicate back themselves. They are docile and used by most cat for simple chores that require the extra limbs for carrying or lifting.

                                Grasswater. Their musical trill as they climb the mountains is said, in catlore, to be a song of praise between life and the living land.

                            <dd>
                                A large flamingo type bird on Iftmus that keeps to the air unless nesting in the high cliff areas. It sings to its mate in flight and for the most part is nocturnal.
                                It&#39;s song has created catlore that says &ldquo;The wandering bird,  carrying it&#39;s lament across the lonely night skies shall remind all cat to listen to the land, for
                                Iftmus speaks even when none might hear&rdquo;. A lesser-known proverb calls it &ldquo;the voice of all cats that have died violently crying out for home&rdquo;.

                                On Iftmus this is a gray and white stripped creature about three feet tall, very affectionate but deadly with it&#39;s front short paws. It can jump high or long but cannot
                                keep that pace for any length of time. Another major food source for the cats.

                            <dd>
                                A breed of cat much like a mountain lion but vaguely reminiscent of a small version of the Saber tooth cats who first ruled Iftmus, probably due more to the small fangs that
                                protrude outside the lips from the lower jaw than any other physical characteristic.

                                <span>(La-hore-ann)</span> This lion-like breed has been the ruling cat in Iftmus since the passing on of the Sa-bata cat as a race. It was during the
                                latter part of their rule that cat began drawn the deathblood of cat. The strength of their rule, even in the face of such abomination is that they are supported by
                                the Ti-breen cat, another larger cat more militia minded, but more important, the Pan-duran cat with their magic&#39;s. Since the Cha-tain keep to their Grasswater and
                                have no active interest in the politics of Iftmus, there is none to challenge the Li-horan rule.

                                into squabbling tribes whose inner conflicts have always kept them from being any threat to other races. Extremely vicious and cannibalistic by nature. They are by virtue of
                                numbers, if ever organized, a force to be reckoned with.

                                shallow water regions of the lakes on Iftmus.  Fast in the water it is more than slow moving on land, crushing its victim and then injecting it with a venom that decomposes its
                                flesh. This makes the prey deadly and offensive to other animals while allowing the snake to leave it and come back later at its leisure to eat.

                                <span>(Purr-row-see-ah)</span> Related to the small chimpanzee like Gindoo on Iftmus, these ferocious cousins are five feet of muscle with violent tempers and are
                                carnivorous. They dwell in the forests of Pa-tan of Iftmus.

                                <span>(Sa-bought-a)</span> This sabertooth cat was the mother of the race and the first ruling cat in Iftmus. It was the Sa-bata cat that received the gift of Ky-lor and
                                touched upon the first powers of "Sha-talon". All breeds owe allegiance and honor this cat, though in recent times it has slipped into more catlore than history.

                                Conservative estimates place the race over ten thousand spans old each generation living at least five hundred spans. Ageless and mischievous they have always been the most peaceful of

                                A large breed of fly attracted mainly to carrion and the biggest source of pestilence and disease on Axtoph.  The difference between them and the more common horse flies lay not only in their size
                                but their ability to attack as an organized swarm.

                                is slightly more addictive than true tanka.

                                <span>(Watch-a-wood)</span> A rare white hardwood found only in the lowland forests in the province of Tasqua on Axtoph. Used in the past by Elvon artists like marble, to make sculptures
                                that, by virtue of the unique wood grain, creates a shimmering and the look of movement.

						<dt>Windtalkers</dt> 
                            <dd>Trees common to the province of La-mor in Iftmus. Profuse around the Takinta Glade near Pursong these trees produce leaves that have stiff spines. When they rub together in the wind the leaves produce
                                a sound that resembles the mewing of a newborn kitten.

                                to bring down several Ti-breen cats. For the most part it hunts smaller animals or sick or separated cat, mostly at night.
