            the anti-thesis of the creative force has found its&#39; host disciples in the Shinghaut priest of the late Babylon. They in turn have passed
            their deadly gifts on to thier new pawns on each of the three worlds. Now Iftmus, the land cats are in their death throes as the newly perverted
            magics of Sha-talon twist and pervert the balance of Flow.

            and piece together some of the related prophesies. Since their own worlds are threatened as well, they are forced by events to set off in search
            of Greenstone, the corridor between all three worlds.

            who possessed the magics before the Panduran cat claimed thier new twisted version. It is here that one of the heroes must bury the demon of his own madness
            lest it betray his true motives. Another must do battle with race and age prejudices before they can even begin to confront the true enemy. A third must
            die and lose all innocence, if others are ever to be granted a chance at any type of life.
