			<h3>There Is A New Dark God on Iftmus!</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						The once proud heritage of the Sa-bata cat, the first ruling breed in Iftmus, is now as good as forgotten; lost in the violent new reign
						of the Li-horan and the elusive Pan-duran cat, as foretold in the prophecies of Ky-lor. <br><br>
						This is a time where there is no honor, no rules; only deceit and cowardice that will shame the Spirit of Felis and all cat that have ever dwelt upon fair Iftmus.<br><br>
						Sha-talon, the magic&#39;s of the long departed Abyssinian cat, are being perverted in their resurrection by the dark evil Pan-duran cat. Iftmus, the
						living land, writhes in silent agony, trembling in the pain of its own desecration. Its tremors can be felt, even in the distant provinces, as ominous
						firestorms sweep the sky over the Pri-hy Mountains in the ruling province of Pa-tan.<br><br>
						Ky-lor, the once precious laws, histories and prophecies of Iftmus, are being relegated to cat lore.  This is the time of prophecy, the beginning of the end,
						the herald to the coming of the Nakostoma &ldquo;The Outsiders&rdquo;. Three from Terra arrive and meet up with three from Axtoph. They in turn meet up with the three from Iftmus.
						The Nakostoma are now a reality and as predicted, the final sign, the very worst of abominations has come to pass. Cat are drawing the deathblood of cat!					
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is A New Dark God on Axtoph!</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						For the first time in recorded history, Elbron, the queen city of the Da-ton Empire is threatened. The Mingstaugh Goblia hordes have left their mountain holds
						and gone beyond their usual annoying raids in the high passes. Possessed and driven by a demonic force, they have almost destroyed the entire race of Sanchean
						Fayra in the Aleation Forests. Even the Denrus Trolya warriors, the powerful feared legion guard of the Elbron Council, pledged to protect the Fayras, have
						been powerless against them.<br><br>
						Whole race annihilation has begun, the like of which threatens to overshadow the Two Span War that decimated the Elvon Race.<br><br>
						Along with the rumored existence of a new mad god, there is now an unexpected force among the dead. Elvon warlords and their dragons have returned to Axtoph
						to find their whole race decimated in a past war. Armed with the Willaward, as predicted by the book of Tashon, they now lead a vengeful army of spirits, bent on the
						destruction of all who participated in the extinction of their race. Suddenly there are so many allies for the cause of chaos. For the first time in recorded history,
						this last bastion of the mage world appears to be little more than helpless.
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is A New Dark God on Terra!</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						The end is actually the beginning. An ever-growing, perverted cult of Shinghaut priests have inherited new powers that rival the old gods of Babylon and Egypt.
						While establishing their fanatic, religious order and reinitiating blood sacrifice, some of these priests have traversed to Iftmus and trained the Pan-duran cat
						in a twisted new version of Sha-talon, the old magic&#39;s. More have gone to Axtoph and have raised the race of Mingstaugh Goblia up to demon status.<br><br>
						Meanwhile their bloody zealous cult on earth threatens to overthrow two aging Empires. Out of the ashes of Babylon and Egypt, they seek to create a new order that
						would crush the newly emerging, civilized world while ushering in a new dark age. Due to their very actions, a pending alternate history might very well show that
						here in this time, the Persian Empire was halted and brought to its knees. Never will the Alexandrian Empire ever extend to a portion of its destined glory.<br><br>
						Now there are three worlds woven together by a new, evil thread of blood, death and chaos. The Shinghaut Priests have set in motion a change of history on all three
						worlds that will herald the end of times and the coming of the mad god Baushra&#39;!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is A New Dark God!</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Baushra&#39; is the name of the mad god worshipped on Terra by the Shinghaut, a name that is the anti-thesis of the creative force. Known on Iftmus as Mauca-taun
						and on Axtoph as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Once merely a part of the balance of creation and life, Baushra&#39; has separated itself and seeks to become
						its own entity by first overpowering the balance on these three worlds. It has sought out and found it&#39;s worldly hosts and is using them to spread the imbalance.
						The younger god, malevolent, yet with purpose, is an unchecked disease whose only goal is to change the balance of creation.<br><br>
						Its only desire is to defile all that has been created and unmake everything to its own likeness, chaos and darkness. By doing so, Baushra&#39; gathers sustenance in
						the physical world and that manifestation will be the body of the new god that revels in all the misery therein!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Prophecy!</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						The end of time is in motion. The beginning of the end will be marked by the joining of &ldquo;three from three worlds&rdquo;.<br><br>
						On Terra, Aumerabi Istaer, the mad Shinghaut priest speaks directly to his god and is writing his own prophecies.<br><br>
						On Axtoph the Book of Tashon speaks of a day when despite losing a war, the Willaward will open a door and the wrath of the decimated Elvon race will manifest itself as
						a new god of wrath.<br><br>
						On Iftmus it is spoken in Ky-lor that the worst of abominations shall herald the end times. Cat shall draw the death blood of cat.<br><br>
						Then, three from three worlds, the nine shall come together. One from each world shall have the magic&#39;s; one from each shall be the warrior; and one from each shall be
						the healer. It is said &ldquo;&#46;&#46;&#46;they will not only challenge the old, but they will destroy the new; crushing the dreams of three worlds and bringing pain even
						unto their own souls. They will gather among them the strong and the weak and will bring life and death to friend and foe alike.&rdquo; Despite the tears that shall accompany them,
						there is one among them who will be the only hope, when the land and all that live upon it, the skies, the universe and it&#39;s many worlds, indeed when the very gods themselves go to war!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Christopher,</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						A troubled seventeen-year-old boy fighting epilepsy and a bitter past, a tragic blend of power and a curse that seems to constantly haunt and stalk him. Of the nine he is <span class="italic">the
						magic from Terra</span>.  For all the power he may discover and wield, his&#46;&#46;&#46;is destined to be a terrible and uncontrolled force. He has come under the scrutiny of the
						dark god and has been named an apt disciple. It was the boys early found ability to walk the roads of his mind that robbed him of his childhood. Now those old roads and
						new ones forced upon him, could end up stealing what little future might have been left. There are those who say his only destiny is to sit at the right hand of the mad god Baushra&#39;!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Joshua</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Christopher&#39;s&#39; five-year-old brother whose only desire is to be a five year old and play, simply enjoying the moment. Of the nine he is <span class="italic">the healer from Terra</span>. The price
						he will pay for that title will steal his innocence. It is said, &ldquo;Only as a child may one walk among the gods.&rdquo; Without innocence there can be no child. Bereft of one
						he can claim none. His life is forfeit if those around him cannot determine why this little boys &ldquo;innocence lost&rdquo; might be a greater weapon and more precious than life!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Nage</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						A sharp tongued sarcastic cat whose bloodlines trace back to the roots of the magic he doesn't even believe in. Of the nine he is <span class="italic">the magic from Iftmus</span>. He is the answer and
						key to a long fabled race of Abyssinian cat that vanished around the age of the perverting of Sha-talon, the lost arts. Neither he nor those who still remain, realize that Nage
						is the one cat that should be feared by all cat in Iftmus. Those who are an integral part of his power, know it not and therefore cannot speak. Too many are predisposed to make
						sure the hidden secret remains that way. Before Nage can look for answers he must learn to believe in the questions. If his heritage and prophecy don't get him killed, his
						doubts and caustic sense of humor just might!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Samone</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						The secretive, moody, old Dwarif Mage, who would rather spend his time drinking in an outland inn than be off on any errand or mission.  Even if the gods themselves commissioned
						him to do so, he would choose to argue.  Of the nine he is <span class="italic">the magic from Axtoph</span>. Despite his drinking and sour moods he is still one of the most respected and powerful wizards
						on his world. Blurring that greatness is guilt. He has thrown away his soul and forsaken his heritage to be rid of the secret that ever haunts him. Buried in his need to escape,
						is a story so far sweeping and devastating&#46;&#46;&#46; he would willingly chose to die, rather than face his, obvious, role in it!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Lere&#39;yll</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Possibly the sole surviving Sanchean Fayra of her whole race. Of the nine she is <span class="italic">the healer from Axtoph</span>. Healer is a contradictive title for one who has been forcibly separated
						from her gods and the living trees she was bonded with. The forests are burning and the trees destroyed. Lere&#39;yll has been bonded to many to preserve her life for she is the
						queen of her race. Her faith has been shaken and a foreign anger kindled. She feels abandoned by her gods; a helpless victim to the myriad ages of every tree her spirit touches.
						One day a child, the next a seductive woman; maybe the next, an ill-tempered crone, none of whom can seem to heal her own aching soul!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Chaltak&#39;</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Of the nine he is <span class="italic">the warrior from Axtoph</span>.  His honor and duty are his pride and his life. Now they have been shaken to the very core. The giant Denrus Trolya, legendary
						warriors sworn to protect the Sanchean Fayra race and yet&#46;&#46;&#46; they have failed most miserably in what should have been, for them, a simple task. The Sanchean Fayras are being 
						decimated and when last he saw, his own warriors defeated. There is no precedent for this. The Denrus Trolya have never been defeated nor even threatened. Chaltak&#39; is a
						warrior most fearsome; a warrior most effective, if&#46;&#46;&#46; this warrior thought he still had the right to live!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Etoshia</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						The haunting renegade priestess who poses her own quandaries!  Of the nine she is <span class="italic">the warrior from Terra</span>. She is not from Iftmus but has attained a
						status among many cat and even spoken of in prophecy. Beneath the mountains on the Grasswater she dwells in secret with the Ch&#39;aun, the outcast mixed breed cats of Iftmus, shunned
						and persecuted by all purebred cat. She herself might be called an outcast. She was once a member of the Shinghaut cult, the very core of the evil destroying the three worlds.
						She now claims she has switched sides!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Ja-bota Cha-tain</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						A bitter Cha-tain cat from the Grasswater who has broken his vow of generations of separation from all other cats, out of the need to avenge the deaths of his mate and cubs. Of the nine
						he is <span class="italic">the warrior from Iftmus</span>. A wise and spiritual cat who is suddenly ripped down to the most basic emotions.  &ldquo;The spirit always battles the flesh&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo; he
						has been quoted as saying, but compound the flesh with family lost and what chance does the spirit stand?  The anger and hatred he nurses have created his own insanity, making him as
						to his allies as the enemy they must fight!
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>There Is Fa-tera</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						The old, &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo; cat. Of the nine she is the healer from Iftmus. She has witnessed a time of change; a time of contradiction. Like a lover unwilling to see the
						betrayal, she merely says she is beyond her time of usefulness, too tired and with little else to offer. In her own words, &ldquo;&#46;&#46;&#46;life should be left to the young.&rdquo;  Prophecy and
						bloodline argue her view. Surely she has not outlived her usefulness nor importance, for if so, why would there be so many who are working so hard to see to this cat&#39;s demise?
