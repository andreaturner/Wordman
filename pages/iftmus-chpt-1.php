                There is a fight within all fights,<br>
                a struggle of the soul,<br>

                shed upward into the air as the flames reeled back from the unprovoked blow, giving the fire the animated appearance of bowing before two cats,
                now entering the clearing. The flickering light danced with the dark, adding deeper shadows to the cloak of formality. A dark, smaller,
                shorthaired cat strode ahead while a larger, white, longhaired cat took pace a respectful distance behind her. The trembling fire-light only
                accentuated, with shadow echoes, the twelve varied breed of cat sitting in a half circle, awaiting the arrival of the two.

                Backdrop to all the cats, the stage for this formal place of testing, was Nalas&#39;; twelve, tall, stone monoliths standing quiet. The granite
                giants were brooding, spaced in a gentle arc, like the curve of a mother cat on her side, nursing her precious young.

                Between the darkening sky and the damp mossy ground, the leaves of the white barked Ac-ca trees shivered under a more casual caress of
                breeze, the subtle sound seeming to applaud the whole scene as its purpose was to witness.

                Fa-tera, the Teacher, strode quietly into the waiting circle of cats. Ja-natia Cha-tain, her San-Tou, or novice teacher stood submissively back

                for this one to listen, and as our ancestors did, judge thy worth.&rdquo;</span>  &nbsp;She gazed quietly upon the faces of her anxious students. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee will, in thy turn, recite Kylor. If thee pass the testing this
