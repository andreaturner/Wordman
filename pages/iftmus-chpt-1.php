                <span class="pt-oet">T</span>he breeze in passing, threw a tantrum gust that slapped maliciously at the shimmering fire. Glittering tears
                shed upward into the air as the flames reeled back from the unprovoked blow, giving the fire the animated appearance of bowing before two cats,
                now entering the clearing. The flickering light danced with the dark, adding deeper shadows to the cloak of formality. A dark, smaller,
                shorthaired cat strode ahead while a larger, white, longhaired cat took pace a respectful distance behind her. The trembling fire-light only
                accentuated, with shadow echoes, the twelve varied breed of cat sitting in a half circle, awaiting the arrival of the two.

                Backdrop to all the cats, the stage for this formal place of testing, was Nalas&#39;; twelve, tall, stone monoliths standing quiet. The granite
                giants were brooding, spaced in a gentle arc, like the curve of a mother cat on her side, nursing her precious young.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Between the darkening sky and the damp mossy ground, the leaves of the white barked Ac-ca trees shivered under a more casual caress of
                breeze, the subtle sound seeming to applaud the whole scene as its purpose was to witness.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Fa-tera, the Teacher, strode quietly into the waiting circle of cats. Ja-natia Cha-tain, her San-Tou, or novice teacher stood submissively back
                while Fa-tera made her pronouncement. <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time, my children.&rdquo;</span> the small dark cat&#39;s head twitched
                with a quick side motion, a nervous tick carried from the sunwalk of her birth, <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time to share what thee have learned.  It is the time
                for this one to listen, and as our ancestors did, judge thy worth.&rdquo;</span>  &nbsp;She gazed quietly upon the faces of her anxious students. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee will, in thy turn, recite Kylor. If thee pass the testing this
                night, thee shall go out and witness Kylor to all cat, carrying on the sacred trust of those that have done so before.&rdquo;</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Fa-tera and Ja-natia nodded, slowly in turn to each of the twelve cats. This semi-submissive bow was part of the ritual of a Teachers acceptance of the younger
                cats worth, at this stage in their testing. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Each of thee is a reminder of what we have been, what we are and what we can be.  If thee pass this testing, let
                all cat acknowledge with respect what thee have earned&#46;&#46;&#46;  and all that thee represent!&rdquo;</span>

            <div class="prologue-text">
                The eye-moons of Re-nell peered through a tattered cloud that was swimming hesitantly across the darkened sky. The white light from the twin moons merely added more of a
                gold wash to the flickering fire in the clearing. The reflections of both fire and moons shimmered in the eyes of each young cat. 
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Fa-tera smiled inwardly. The old teacher knew, should the fire be dead and the moons in hiding, there would still be a youthful touch of spark in all their eyes. They were
                all so anxiously alive; idealistic hearts burning with dream fire!
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                These twelve cats were on the threshold of becoming the newest generation of Shi-kauti, the keepers of Ky-lore in Iftmus. This night was the last sunfall before Di-chant
                and the time of their testing.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Far in the distance a chilling howl, from a roving pack of Woodwars, sliced through the still night air. Fa-tera turned her gaze in the direction of the insidious cry.
                She allowed herself a moment to wonder why a pack was down this far from the lo-hills?
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Woodwars, though ferocious, were basically cowards unless they outnumbered their victims. In packs they could bring down a large, healthy Ti-breen cat. Alone or in pairs
                they would only take on a cat, if it were weakened, wounded, or an unfortunate cub separated from its pride. More often they stalked small defenseless animals, such as
                ra-katoos or stray mud-waumps. True to the viciousness of their breed they were also known to turn on the weaker of their own, when hunger prevailed for fail of the hunt.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                As if hearing her thoughts, Ja-natia Cha-tain faced the breeze with a tilt of her head and then mindspoke. <span class="italic">&ldquo;I sense their hunger but do not
                taste any other purpose in their movements. They are midst hunt and no threat to us.&rdquo;</span> Wisps of her long white fur lashed in the wind like graceful white smoke tendrils.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Another howl went up; this time it was the cry of success. Fa-tera shuddered and gave up a short prayer for the victim that loosed its spirit in the shedding of deathblood.
                She nodded affirmation to her San-Tou and turned her attention back to the circle of cats, sighing, <span class="italic">&ldquo;This is life, the giving and taking of which belongs to the Spirit of Felis.&rdquo;</span>
                With little else to add Fa-tera straightened her stance, <span class="italic">&ldquo;But thee are the conscience of our life. The heart and soul of Iftmus is Kylor&#46;&#46;&#46; the words!&rdquo;</span>
                The old cat blinked and then allowed herself a moment away from formality with an uncharacteristic touch of sentiment. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee, my hearts, are my beloved children and in all of thee,
                I am so very proud.&rdquo;</span> 
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Ja-natia Cha-tain gave pause, with a mental nod, measuring and noting depth of heart of this cat. The eyes of all twelve cats squeezed closed, caught short by the unprecedented flattery from
                their usually strict and formal teacher.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Chosen at birth from various families of cat in the three provinces of Iftmus, these young cats had all been brought to Pursong as kittens. The sanctuary school known as Seftora in the
                Province of La-mor was an isolated glade, a sacred place that lay nestled between Gift-wa, the lake of silent waters and the river, Tears of Rensis. Here in Pursong, Seftora was the place
                of learning, a sanctuary respected by all cat since the early days of the first ruling Sa-bata cats. Here in a vast area of beautiful trees and lush grass, dotted with yellow-green lich
                moss, generations of cat were raised and taught by the Teacher to become Shi-kauti, keepers of Kylor. Here they learned the daily routines of living and survival, as well as being ingrained
                with the histories, the laws, the lore and traditions of all cats of Iftmus. This was what bound all cat to one family. The sum of all cat experience was Kylor!
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                The place of testing, sat right on the Tears Of Rensis, river&#39;s edge. The poetic side of Fa-tera always reveled in the soothing song of the fast flowing water. The water whispered and laughed
                over rocks. It cooed and swallowed itself in deep eddies. It was the teasing of tomorrow to the land that lay before it today. It was an echo of yesterday from the mountains and the heavens
                from which it flowed.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                The river, Tears of Rensis, swept in from the furthest boundaries of the three provinces and met in the middle of Iftmus at the bottomless falls of Fina&#39;sha, the singular place where the tip of
                each of the provinces touched. Something stirred in Fa-tera&#39;s heart. She silently vowed to make a pilgrimage to those falls in the near future.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Nalas&#39;, the stone monoliths that surrounded the cats were a huddle of shadows from the past. The large stones were veined with greenstone and had been placed there by the Abyssinian cats
                that once dwelt in La-mor. There was a peace to their presence, a tie with the past and the heritage of all cat. Only once an eight-season did they stir, as they had the so many sunwalks
                before when Fa-tera had prepared for this testing.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Early sunwalk past, Fa-tera had entered Nalas&339; from the riverside. The tall rocks shifted and grated within like the clearing of a stone throat. A group voice, many but one, spoke out
                to her before she even faced the monoliths. &ldquo;Who&#46;&#46;&#46;, wakes&#46;&#46;&#46;, us?&rdquo; The voice was low and gritty like the rumbling of earth when stone caresses stone.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                The greenstone glowed, as did Fa-tera&339;s eyes. <span class="italic">#ldquo;I am the Teacher. Thee are awakened by the time of testing. At next sunfall thee shall stand witness as thee have

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                The air around the monoliths suddenly felt oppressive, giving the feeling as if all were under the weight of mountains from which the stones came. <span class="italic">&ldquo;We&#46;&#46;&#46;
                may&#46;&#46;&#46; not&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46; It&#46;&#46;&#46; is&#46;&#46;&#46; not&#46;&#46;&#46; the&#46;&#46;&#46; time&#46;&#46;&#46; for&#46;&#46;&#46; telling. We&#46;&#46;&#46; may&#46;&#46;&#46;

                telling!&rdquo;</span>
                The stones drifted quiet fell back asleep. They would only awaken again for the time of testing.

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                &ldquo;Fa-tera will do the telling?&rdquo; She cursed and shook her head as if trying to rid herself the question; to no avail. What did Nalas&#39; mean by that? She was not a Shi-kauti.
                Greatly troubled she walked off to follow the river-water&#39;s chatter and waited for the sunwalk to pass.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Now at this sunfall, Fa-tera still wondered, but let that wonder be swept to the side by her own anxiousness for her students. Restless on its own accord, the fire crackled with excitement
                and threw out tiny, falling-star sparks that burned themselves out in multitudes of wishes before ever reaching the damp moss on the ground. Fa-tera added her own wish in among them. She
                sighed as she looked proudly into the eyes of her children. She had raised them all, and she would now have to let them go. Why was it always, such a bite to the heart?

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Among the varied cat before her, some were nearly three times Fa-tera&#39;s size, yet they all gazed lovingly back at her, as any small cub might its own natural mother. She shook off the warm,
                as well as the subtle cold of what she was feeling. Finally with some reluctance she put on the veil of strict formality; the occasion demanded that she, as Teacher, do no less.

                Ja-natia&#39;s eyes fell upon Sa-hetra, the first cat chosen to recite a portion of Kylor. The small, cat squeezed her eyes shut in silent thanks for the privilege of being first chosen,
                and with those eyes still closed, she mind-spoke out:

                The testing of Kylor continued as Fa-tera turned her attention to the dwindling fire. It dodged and hid behind dying embers crackling with mischievous laughter. The Teacher&#39;s
                green eyes betrayed her part Abyssinian blood and turned a phosphorous glow. She nodded towards a large dry thornthistle branch, and with a flash that emanated first from her eyes,
                the branch burst into flame. She had used that part of Sha-talon called Ma-hosta, &ldquo;fire of dreams&rdquo;. A crescendo of fire washed the clearing with renewed, warm light.

                The Gindoo had been busy the sunfall past, placing many branch-laden fire sites around Nalas&#39;. The two-legged hairy animals were good-natured and easily taught simple tasks.
                They relished encouragement and praise and like the Chaun, they seemed to have a limited understanding of Ma&#39;chona, &ldquo;Mindspeak.&rdquo; The Gindoo could hear but not mindspeak
                back. They resembled the Pur-rocia that dwelt in the forests of Pa-tan, but unlike their ferocious cousins, the Gindoo were a smaller, more intelligent breed. The two extra limbs not
                used for walking were ideal for carrying and moving things. Fa-tera had no qualms with their treatment here in Sefttora and other parts of La-mor, but she was uncomfortably aware of the
                more slave-like conditions of they and their cousins in the province of Pa-tan.

                The distant grunts of mud-waumps drifted in off the waters of Green-wa. The fat furry creatures were enjoying the warmth of the shallow waters this sunfall. Evenings like these were an
                ideal time for the waddling beasts to come out of the lake and bask, as the cool night wrestled with the last vestiges of a hot, humid day.

                A soft, early sunfall breeze rustled the leaves of the Windtalkers, which grew profusely here along the Takinta Glades. The weeping limbs nodded and rocked as the stiff spines on the
                leaves rubbed together, producing a whining, much like the mewing of newborn cubs. The old Teacher forced herself to shut out the soothing sound and turn her attention back to the testing.

                The white smoke and the rising heat from the fire caused the Eye Moons of Re-nell to shimmer and weave in the dark sky, as if they were misting in the romance of ancient catlore.
                The moons were bright tonight, hypnotic, and again Fa-tera had to cast off the trance to focus back in.

                other prides against the vast hordes of Woodwars that invaded in those last days, Ren-fa shed his deathblood upon the lo-hills of La-mor.  To this day it is the traces of his gallant
                struggle, the wash of colors in those hills, that remind us of the sacrifice cat should make for cat.&rdquo;
