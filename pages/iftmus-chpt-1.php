                        shed upward into the air as the flames reeled back from the unprovoked blow, giving the fire the animated appearance of bowing before two cats,
                        now entering the clearing. The flickering light danced with the dark, adding deeper shadows to the cloak of formality. A dark, smaller,
                        shorthaired cat strode ahead while a larger, white, longhaired cat took pace a respectful distance behind her. The trembling fire-light only
                        accentuated, with shadow echoes, the twelve varied breed of cat sitting in a half circle, awaiting the arrival of the two.

                        Backdrop to all the cats, the stage for this formal place of testing, was Nalas&#39;; twelve, tall, stone monoliths standing quiet. The granite

                        Between the darkening sky and the damp mossy ground, the leaves of the white barked Ac-ca trees shivered under a more casual caress of
                        breeze, the subtle sound seeming to applaud the whole scene as its purpose was to witness.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Fa-tera, the Teacher, strode quietly into the waiting circle of cats. Ja-natia Cha-tain, her San-Tou, or novice teacher stood submissively back
                        while Fa-tera made her pronouncement. <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time, my children.&rdquo;</span> the small dark cat&#39;s head twitched
                        with a quick side motion, a nervous tick carried from the sunwalk of her birth, <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time to share what thee have learned.  It is the time
                        for this one to listen, and as our ancestors did, judge thy worth.&rdquo;</span>  &nbsp;She gazed quietly upon the faces of her anxious students. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee will, in thy turn, recite Kylor. If thee pass the testing this

                        Fa-tera and Ja-natia nodded, slowly in turn to each of the twelve cats. This semi-submissive bow was part of the ritual of a Teachers acceptance of the younger
                        cats worth, at this stage in their testing. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Each of thee is a reminder of what we have been, what we are and what we can be.  If thee pass this testing, let

                        The eye-moons of Re-nell peered through a tattered cloud that was swimming hesitantly across the darkened sky. The white light from the twin moons merely added more of a
                        gold wash to the flickering fire in the clearing. The reflections of both fire and moons shimmered in the eyes of each young cat.

                        Fa-tera smiled inwardly. The old teacher knew, should the fire be dead and the moons in hiding, there would still be a youthful touch of spark in all their eyes. They were
                        all so anxiously alive; idealistic hearts burning with dream fire!

                        These twelve cats were on the threshold of becoming the newest generation of Shi-kauti, the keepers of Ky-lore in Iftmus. This night was the last sunfall before Di-chant
                        and the time of their testing.

                        Far in the distance a chilling howl, from a roving pack of Woodwars, sliced through the still night air. Fa-tera turned her gaze in the direction of the insidious cry.
                        She allowed herself a moment to wonder why a pack was down this far from the lo-hills?
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Woodwars, though ferocious, were basically cowards unless they outnumbered their victims. In packs they could bring down a large, healthy Ti-breen cat. Alone or in pairs
                        they would only take on a cat, if it were weakened, wounded, or an unfortunate cub separated from its pride. More often they stalked small defenseless animals, such as
                        ra-katoos or stray mud-waumps. True to the viciousness of their breed they were also known to turn on the weaker of their own, when hunger prevailed for fail of the hunt.

                        As if hearing her thoughts, Ja-natia Cha-tain faced the breeze with a tilt of her head and then mindspoke. <span class="italic">&ldquo;I sense their hunger but do not
                        taste any other purpose in their movements. They are midst hunt and no threat to us.&rdquo;</span> Wisps of her long white fur lashed in the wind like graceful white smoke tendrils.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Another howl went up; this time it was the cry of success. Fa-tera shuddered and gave up a short prayer for the victim that loosed its spirit in the shedding of deathblood.
                        She nodded affirmation to her San-Tou and turned her attention back to the circle of cats, sighing, <span class="italic">&ldquo;This is life, the giving and taking of which belongs to the Spirit of Felis.&rdquo;</span>
                        With little else to add Fa-tera straightened her stance, <span class="italic">&ldquo;But thee are the conscience of our life. The heart and soul of Iftmus is Kylor&#46;&#46;&#46; the words!&rdquo;</span>
                        The old cat blinked and then allowed herself a moment away from formality with an uncharacteristic touch of sentiment. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee, my hearts, are my beloved children and in all of thee,
                        I am so very proud.&rdquo;</span>

                        Ja-natia Cha-tain gave pause, with a mental nod, measuring and noting depth of heart of this cat. The eyes of all twelve cats squeezed closed, caught short by the unprecedented flattery from
                        their usually strict and formal teacher.

                        Chosen at birth from various families of cat in the three provinces of Iftmus, these young cats had all been brought to Pursong as kittens. The sanctuary school known as Seftora in the
                        Province of La-mor was an isolated glade, a sacred place that lay nestled between Gift-wa, the lake of silent waters and the river, Tears of Rensis. Here in Pursong, Seftora was the place
                        of learning, a sanctuary respected by all cat since the early days of the first ruling Sa-bata cats. Here in a vast area of beautiful trees and lush grass, dotted with yellow-green lich
                        moss, generations of cat were raised and taught by the Teacher to become Shi-kauti, keepers of Kylor. Here they learned the daily routines of living and survival, as well as being ingrained
                        with the histories, the laws, the lore and traditions of all cats of Iftmus. This was what bound all cat to one family. The sum of all cat experience was Kylor!

                        The place of testing, sat right on the Tears Of Rensis, river&#39;s edge. The poetic side of Fa-tera always reveled in the soothing song of the fast flowing water. The water whispered and laughed
                        over rocks. It cooed and swallowed itself in deep eddies. It was the teasing of tomorrow to the land that lay before it today. It was an echo of yesterday from the mountains and the heavens
                        from which it flowed.

                        each of the provinces touched. Something stirred in Fa-tera&#39;s heart. She silently vowed to make a pilgrimage to those falls in the near future.

                        that once dwelt in La-mor. There was a peace to their presence, a tie with the past and the heritage of all cat. Only once an eight-season did they stir, as they had the so many sunwalks
                        before when Fa-tera had prepared for this testing.

                        and threw out tiny, falling-star sparks that burned themselves out in multitudes of wishes before ever reaching the damp moss on the ground. Fa-tera added her own wish in among them. She
                        sighed as she looked proudly into the eyes of her children. She had raised them all, and she would now have to let them go. Why was it always, such a bite to the heart?

                        green eyes betrayed her part Abyssinian blood and turned a phosphorous glow. She nodded towards a large dry thornthistle branch, and with a flash that emanated first from her eyes,
                        the branch burst into flame. She had used that part of Sha-talon called Ma-hosta, &ldquo;fire of dreams&rdquo;. A crescendo of fire washed the clearing with renewed, warm light.

                        They relished encouragement and praise and like the Chaun, they seemed to have a limited understanding of Ma&#39;chona, &ldquo;Mindspeak.&rdquo; The Gindoo could hear but not mindspeak
                        back. They resembled the Pur-rocia that dwelt in the forests of Pa-tan, but unlike their ferocious cousins, the Gindoo were a smaller, more intelligent breed. The two extra limbs not
                        used for walking were ideal for carrying and moving things. Fa-tera had no qualms with their treatment here in Sefttora and other parts of La-mor, but she was uncomfortably aware of the
                        more slave-like conditions of they and their cousins in the province of Pa-tan.

                        her children! For the first time in the Teacher&#39;s whole life she conceded she was old; she flinched. Admission did not make the fact any more palatable. The cat chuckled to herself
                        and quickly amended, &ldquo;Maybe not so much old as thee are just&#46;&#46;&#46; weary.&rdquo; She blinked. It was a tired that crept down into her bones and splashed back out in the
                        gray hairs that flecked her once shiny black coat. Again her head twitched and she laughed inwardly. &ldquo;What a portrait thee must portray.&rdquo; Truly, it was getting close to the
                        time for her to pass down the title of &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo;. Pass it down to Ja-natia, just as Fa-sinto had passed it down to her, when she was his San-Tou, so many sunfalls ago. The

                        different part of Flow: the balance of all life and land in Iftmus. From it they drew Sha-talon, the magic&#39;s of Iftmus. Ma-chona, &ldquo;The whisper of Felis&rdquo; was mindspeak
                        and the Sa-bata cat had taught that. The Abyssinians touched a different part of Sha-talon; Ma-nasta, &ldquo;The weight of ages,&rdquo; which allowed them to move things by levitation.
                        Ma-hosta, &ldquo;The fire of dreams,7rdquo; allowed them to create fire as Fa-tera just had. Ma-chena, &ldquo;The steps of the wind,&rdquo allowed them to transport themselves or others
                        short distances. Up till now no other cat had ever mastered those aspects of the gifts. Eventually the Abyssinians moved up onto the Grasswater, separating themselves and any further

                        those cats just as private. Ja-natia herself had refused to be broached on the subject. What was the secret? What was more important than the truth of Kylor? How long were they to go on

                        There was one sad truth that stood out from wistful speculation. Since the Abyssinian cats had disappeared, there was an uneasiness seeping into the land, a feeling of wrong that refused
                        to be cast off. It was much like a damp fog sitting just footfalls ahead, always out of touch no matter how hard one tried to chase it down.  It was oppressive and it was only getting worse.

                        Kylor told how, earlier in Iftmus, most cats broke off into feuding prides and started claiming territories. Even Ren-sis could not bring order or caring back. Something vile had overshadowed
                        the land and was suffocating the spirit of every living thing.

                        longer in harmony. There was no peace to be felt, only a vague sense of torment: a whisper-promise of impending doom. The worst part of all this was the gossamer fear-feeling she had long
                        cradled; a feeling that somewhere, something seemed to be enjoying all of this, taking sustenance like a kitten from its mother&#39;s teat. She could feel its consuming greed, its insatiable
                        hunger. It was a hunger that would not stop feeding till all life was sucked dry.

                        sunfalls, or was her faith being shaken in the bite of a more subtle truth? Despite the self-scolding, Fa-tera's thoughts had taken her too close to her own buried doubts. Thanks to the
                        spiritual stumble, she was recognizing those doubts and in so doing, giving them a life of their own. From here on, the cat had no choice but to be haunted by the whispers of all she had,

                        shivered. Could this mean that past Shi-kauti had some part in placing insidious lies or half-truths into Kylor? She had to believe they couldn&#39;t. They were her adopted cubs, chosen,
                        raised, and tested, all so carefully. She was responsible for them, for Kylor, for all cats in Iftmus!

                        Cry-mar, down near the borders of La-mor and Pa-tan?  More questions with yet fewer answers. Why did the land itself feel so wrong? Why wasn&#39;t Kylor keeping up with even the local gossip?
                        Why had her two older pair of Shi-kauti not returned from Pa-tan last Di-Chant? Questions chasing their tails, plaguing like pestering carrion-eaters awaiting the death of a next meal.

                        past sunfalls, to bring up to date any changes or additions to Kylor. Occasionally a few had, in the past, missed Di-Chant due to traveling conditions or circumstances in their respected
                        province, but they would always show later. Four Shi-kauti had not shown up last Di-Chant or been heard from since.

                        Shi-kauti had to return to relinquish their roles to their younger heirs. None of her children had ever missed this Di-Chant, no Shi-kauti for any reason at any time! Certainly none ever

                        The last verses were quietly mindspoken by Chi-kaw, a Lingst cat from the low hills in the southern portion of La-mor. He was a quiet, solitary cat with a troubled spirit.
                        Though he had no enemies here, throughout his training, it could certainly be said that he allowed few friends other than Fa-tera and Sa-toug&#39; the Shi-kauti he would
                        travel across La-mor with. Still he made up in fervor and faith what he lacked in social grace.

                        Fa-tera closed her eyes, drifting in the currents and the dark mood of these and many of the prophecies of Pursong. Eddies of memories swept her back to when she was
                        first brought to Sefttora as a cub.

                        Young Fa-tera had a reckless sense of adventure. She refused to stay where the old Teacher, Fa-sinto had directed the new cubs to play. Instead she had cautiously followed
                        the old cat. It was then she had seen her first and last Abyssinian ancestor, by virtue of her own partial blood. The Abyssinian&#39;s name had been Bastet, no larger than some
                        of the smaller cats residing in La-mor, but there was a majesty that emanated from her, a very power in her presence. Bastet&#39;s silver black fur was sleek and there was
                        a grace in her walk that made her look ageless.

                        Of the many things Fa-tera would remember, it was the Abyssinian&#39;s eyes that haunted her memories. Those eyes had been much greener than her own and they danced with a
                        fire that burned constantly and not just when the cat was using Sha-talon. It was a flood of green, alive, fighting with itself to keep from spilling out.

                        her gaze upon the young cat, there was only a warm wash of love that made the kitten want to return the same. Unbidden, Fa-tera stepped out from
                        behind the bush where she hid and walked slowly forward, sniffing, seeking mood, until the two cats were almost nose to nose.

                        little sister, thee and I will be seeing each other again.&rdquo;<span> The Abyssinian cat scrutinized Fa-tera even closer, a touch of magic reaching out
                        from her burning eyes. It snaked in and around Fa-tera&#39;s head and then returned from whence it came. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Yes&#46;&#46;&#46; yes my

                        thee are numbered.&rdquo;</span> There was a buzz&#46;&#46;&#46; a numbing of the mind that caused the rest of the words to slur. When Fa-tera shook her head
                        the old cat was smiling, almost sadly. She addressed her for the first time by name. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Fa-tera, thy blood is the blood of all cats,
                        even ours. Judge not harshly, for there are stories beneath stories, words behind words. Surely even the foolish wise cannot know them all!

                        There was melancholy to Bastet&#39;s strange benediction but as she turned and walked away, Fa-tera had no time to ponder it. Fa-sinto, her teacher had just
                        returned. Thinking she had been innocently pestering their guest he cuffed her lightly on the ear with a gentle swipe of his paw. <span class="italic"></span>

                        been an enigma. She alone, among all Ch&#39;aun, could Ma-chona &ldquo;mindspeak&rdquo;. This was a gift all cat of pure blood shared. Though mixed bloods could hear the
                        Ma-chona of other cats, they could not mindspeak back. They could not draw Ma-nasta, <span class="italic">&ldquo;The weight of the spirit&rdquo;</span>or Ma-hosta,
                        <span class="italic">&ldquo;The fire of dreams&rdquo;</span> or Ma-chena, <span class="itlaic">&ldquo;The trails of the wind&rdquo;</span> and thus came the abuse
                        nurtured by the ignorance and arrogance of most cat of pure blood. Ch&#39;aun were treated as lesser cat.

                        and the gindoo. It felt the perverting of Sha-talon and the abomination of cat drawing death blood of cat. It wept, as Ky-lor itself was found lacking and incomplete.

                        and the musky plains sand that was routinely spread across the plank floor.

                        A low fire burned continually in the large fireplace keeping stews warm and the inn blessedly comfortable. Murmurs and swearing mingled with the roll of dice and clank
                        of tankards. All were as much the ambiance of the tavern as the rowdy arguments and slurred boastings. Most of the varied patrons milling around the soured d&#233;cor,
                        settled toward the back of the cave, letting the mountain's breast cradle them from the sounds of the angry winds outside.

                        accept both watered ale and overpriced fare, while sullenly conversing and arguing the price of an additional room, bed or company for the night.

                        and disorganized to ever fall in behind one leader. As far back as is recorded, they have accomplished nothing but to remain petty warring tribes. Except for the few times
                        that someone was foolish enough to intrude upon their mountain lands, their fighting has always remained amongst themselves. March in force?&rdquo; He snorted,

                        The north road to Sedgehak, a port city on the Bordic Coast, was ominously deserted. With the exception of an occasional vagabond or peddler, the ride was an endless
                        tedium of barren plain that swallowed the strong cantering beat of two straining horses.

                       Samone didn&#39;t want to be here. He had left all this behind, bearing his own demons and now, suddenly he was forced to go back. Every step retraced his own sins and
                       he wasn&#39;t sure which was worse, the secret he was running from or the disaster he was running to. The bite of cold air was tinged with the faint scent of fear; he
                       wondered if anyone else could smell it?

                       The first signs of life were large wheat fields, shivering quietly, despite the lack of wind. From distant huts, across half-harvested fields, farmers and their families
                       watched suspiciously, while occasional stray dogs chased after the two travelers. The looks and defiant barks were predestined to fall off their shoulders and trail away
                       behind them.

                       Over the full course of the daca&#39; the weary riders stopped only to feed and rest the horses and then push on at Mauldren&#39;s insistence. The brief naps did nothing to
                       take the edge off Samone&#39;s disposition. Several times the Dwarif cursed and muttered how real friends wouldn&#39;t inflict such hardship while taking such obvious pleasure
                       in the deed! Then with a renewed curse he would spur his mount to catch up with his laughing friend. Samone had traveled this road many times. It was strange how a path so
                       often traveled now felt so alien, so uncomfortable.
